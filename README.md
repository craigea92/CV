## Craig Eaton

After working in Marketing for 3 years, I decided that I wanted a new challenge. Becoming a software developer really appealed to me. I love working on projects and seeing them come to life, such as a small snippets of code transitioning into fully fledged web apps.

## Skills

- Attention to Detail - At Cliphair, I was solely responsible for each and every marketing email we sent to customers. I had to read through each email, blog and any content attached to the email. This meant reading through the same piece of text atleast 3 times, checking and making sure every single link was interactive and working, making sure the email was readable on mobile, desktop & tablet and mobile.
As a result, every marketing email sent to our customers showed Cliphair in the best way possible and we always had sales as a direct result of those emails.

- Initiative - Whilst working at Standard Brands, I had been tasked with updating the UK website to add a "Buy Now" button on some of our popular products. I had only really touched HTML & CSS at this time and I wasn't sure how I could do this. I quickly began to research online and with a little trial & error, I managed to create a button that linked through to the Tesco website. This resulted in more customers finding our products instore & online, we saw a growth in online sales from Tesco after this button was introduced.
